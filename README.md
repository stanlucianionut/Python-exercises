# **Python Practice Exercises**

A collection of beginner-friendly and intermediate Python exercises designed to build fundamental programming skills through small, focused scripts. Each `.py` file demonstrates a specific concept such as user input handling, loops, conditionals, functions, and basic logic design.

## **Included Exercises**

### **1. calculator.py**
A simple arithmetic calculator that performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.

### **2. dice_game.py**
Simulates a small dice-rolling game using random number generation and simple game-flow logic.

### **3. fizzbuzz.py**
Classic programming exercise using conditional logic to print number patterns based on divisibility rules.

### **4. movie_schedule.py**
Outputs a schedule of movies with basic data structures and formatting. Demonstrates lists, dictionaries, and iteration.

### **5. prime_number_check.py**
Checks whether a given number is prime. Uses loops and conditional statements to validate user input.

### **6. rock_paper_scissors.py**
Interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors game against the computer using randomization and decision logic.

### **7. roll_dice.py**
Simple utility script to simulate rolling one or more dice. Demonstrates loops, randomness, and printing formatted results.

### **8. security_prompt.py**
A basic security prompt that asks users for credentials or responses. Implements simple input validation and conditional branching.
